Remote control of SPIKE Prime hub using Windows machine (that has bluetooth).

Demo vid: https://youtu.be/cMHl7u8XiDw

Use v2 of the Spike Prime app, not V3. V3 didn't have Python yet as of publishing this code.

"gamepad.py" will help you figure out how to get values from the controller.

"uart_example.py" is ripped from Bleak's examples, with a few mods.

I didn't do anything novel here, just piecing together stuff from here and there. :)

Enjoy!
